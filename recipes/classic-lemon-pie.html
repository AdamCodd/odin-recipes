    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The lemon pie is a type of dessert pie, consisting of a shortened pastry base filled with lemon curd and topped with meringue. This recipe was made for eight servings.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>¼ cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>¼ cup lemon juice</li>
        <li>3 large egg yolks, slightly beaten</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon zest</li>
        <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
        <li>1 (9 inch) baked pie crust</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine sugar, milk, butter, lemon juice, egg yolks, cornstarch, and lemon zest in a medium saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until thick, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from heat, cover, and let cool, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Fold in sour cream; pour into the baked pie crust. Chill in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Beat egg whites, sugar, and cornstarch together in a bowl using an electric mixer until stiff peaks form. Spread meringue on top of filling, right up to the edge of the crust.</li>
        <li>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.</li>
        <li>Broil in the preheated oven until meringue is lightly browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
