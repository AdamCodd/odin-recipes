    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pastry for a 9 inch double crust pie</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons tapioca</li>
        <li>Â½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>2 cups fresh blackberries</li>
        <li>2 cups apples - peeled, cored and sliced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, cut into small pieces</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). On a lightly floured surface, roll out one crust, and place in a 9 inch pie plate. Roll out top crust, and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, mix together the sugar, tapioca, and cinnamon. Add blackberries and apple slices. Toss gently to coat without mashing the berries. Let stand for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Spoon filling into pastry lined pan. Dot with butter. Moisten the edge of the pastry with water. Cover with top crust; trim and crimp edge. Cut a few slits in the top to allow steam to escape during baking. Cover edge with foil to prevent over-browning.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and continue baking for 20 to 25 minutes, or until crust is golden brown. Cool on wire rack.</li>
    </ol>
